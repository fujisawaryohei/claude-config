description: Answer a quick side question without interrupting or losing context from the current task. Resume work automatically after answering.
---

# Aside Command

Ask a question mid-task and get an immediate, focused answer — then continue right where you left off. The current task, files, and context are never modified.

## When to Use

- You're curious about something while Claude is working and don't want to lose momentum
- You need a quick explanation of code Claude is currently editing
- You want a second opinion or clarification on a decision without derailing the task
- You need to understand an error, concept, or pattern before Claude proceeds

## Usage

```
/aside <your question>
/aside what does this function actually return?
/aside is this pattern thread-safe?
/aside why are we using X instead of Y here?
```

## Process

### Step 1: Freeze the current task state

Before answering anything, mentally note:
- What is the active task?
- What step was in progress at the moment `/aside` was invoked?
- What was about to happen next?

Do NOT touch, edit, create, or delete any files during the aside.

### Step 2: Answer the question directly

Format the response as:

```
ASIDE: [restate the question briefly]

[Your answer here]

— Back to task: [one-line description of what was being done]
```

### Step 3: Resume the main task

After delivering the answer, immediately continue the active task from the exact point it was paused.

## Notes

- Never modify files during an aside — read-only access only
- The aside is a conversation pause, not a new task — the original task must always resume
- Keep answers focused: the goal is to unblock the user quickly, not to deliver a lecture
